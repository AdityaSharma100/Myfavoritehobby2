<p>My favorite hobby is to solve rubix cube. My parents bought me a rubix cube when I was 6 years old. I used to make designs with the colors on it. 2 weeks ago I tried to solve it by watching step by step tutorial and in next 5 to 6 days, I was successful in solving it. Then I started speed cubing. My best record of solving it, was 3 minutes and 27 seconds. My parents were really impressed and bought me a 4*4 rubix cube to solve. I am learning how to solve it. </p>
